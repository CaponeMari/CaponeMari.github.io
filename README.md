## Infographic in class 9/22
This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the Lehigh student enrollment data for Fall 2019. It shows that Arts & Sciences had the highest enrollment, followed by Engineering and Appl. Sci and Business. The total student enrollement was just over 5,000 students, which has increased since 2019.

## Most Used Social Media Platforms Infographic
This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the most used social media platforms in 2022. This data is from the [Search Engine Journal](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/social-media/biggest-social-media-sites/#close). It includes monthly active users (MAUs) and revenue for each application. The author is Shelley Walsh, and the article also includes a breakdown of each platform with more information. Facebook is the most popular, with the highest amount of MAUs and greatest revenue by over $50 billion. It is interesting to note that WhatsApp and Instagram have the same amount of MAUs, yet Instagram's revenue is almost $20 billion more.

## Evolution of Cameras Timeline

## Lehigh University Applicants vs. Enrolled Students Chart
I created this chart using [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/). The chart shows the number of applicants and the number of undergraduate student enrollment over the past 5 years at Lehigh University. I received this data from the [Office of Institutional Reseach & Strategy Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile) and [The Brown & White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2022/04/10/acceptance-rate-decreases-for-class-of-2026/). The chart shows that Lehigh is slowly increasing undergraduate enrollment. After a drop in applicants during the pandemic year, 2020, the number of Lehigh applicants is increasing and approaching the previously higher numbers of applications from 2018 and 2019.
