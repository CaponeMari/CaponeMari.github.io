Sci and Business. The total student enrollement was just over 5,000 students, which has increased since 2019.

## Most Used Social Media Platforms Infographic
This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the most used social media platforms in 2022.

It includes monthly active users (MAUs) and revenue for each application. The author is Shelley Walsh, and the article also includes a breakdown of each platform with more information. Facebook is the most popular, with the highest amount of MAUs and greatest revenue by over $50 billion. It is interesting to note that WhatsApp and Instagram have the same amount of MAUs, yet Instagram's revenue is almost $20 billion more.

## Lehigh University Applicants vs. Enrolled Students Chart
I created this chart using [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/). The chart shows the number of applicants and the number of undergraduate student enrollment over the past 5 years at Lehigh University. I received this data from the [Office of Institutional Reseach & Strategy Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile) and [The Brown & White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2022/04/10/acceptance-rate-decreases-for-class-of-2026/). The chart shows that Lehigh is slowly increasing undergraduate enrollment. After a drop in applicants during the pandemic year, 2020, the number of Lehigh applicants is increasing and approaching the previously higher numbers of applications from 2018 and 2019.
