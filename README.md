## Self-Introduction
My name is Mari Capone and I am junior at Lehigh University studying journalism and marketing. I am from outside of Boston, MA, and recently moved to live full-time on Cape Cod. I have a 23-year-old brother who graduated from Lehigh last year and also live with my parents and dog named Cooper. 

I will be using this for my data journalism class.
