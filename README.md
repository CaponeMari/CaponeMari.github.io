## Self-Introduction
My name is Mari Capone and I am junior at Lehigh University studying journalism and marketing. I am from outside of Boston, MA, and recently moved to live full-time on Cape Cod. I have a 23-year-old brother who graduated from Lehigh last year and also live with my parents and dog named Cooper. 

I will be using this for my data journalism class.

Sci and Business. The total student enrollement was just over 5,000 students, which has increased since 2019.

## Most Used Social Media Platforms Infographic
This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the most used social media platforms in 2022. This data is from the [Search Engine Journal](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/social-media/biggest-social-media-sites/#close). It includes monthly active users (MAUs) and revenue for each application. The author is Shelley Walsh, and the article also includes a breakdown of each platform with more information. Facebook is the most popular, with the highest amount of MAUs and greatest revenue by over $50 billion. It is interesting to note that WhatsApp and Instagram have the same amount of MAUs, yet Instagram's revenue is almost $20 billion more.

## Evolution of Cameras Timeline
I created a timeline using [TimlineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#make) about the evolution of the camera. I used information from [Inventionland](https://inventionland.com/blog/the-evolution-of-cameras/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_camera). The timeline does not include data after the first digital camera was invented.
